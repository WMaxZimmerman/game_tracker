*Zot the Wizard*

** [[http://slugfestgames.com/games/rdi/rdi-1/][Expansion 1]]
* Description
Zot might have had a cushy job teaching magic theory at the Wizards’ College, 
had he not been saddled with Pooky, a psychotic, binge drinking bunny rabbit, 
as his familiar.
* The Good
Zot is good at card tricks, and, hence, is good at gambling. His mastery of many 
magical spells keeps him well protected, whether he’s roughhousing, drinking, or 
gambling.
* The Bad
That rabbit is insane. Seriously.
